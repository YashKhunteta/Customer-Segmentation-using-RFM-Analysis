# Customer-Segmentation-using-RFM-Analysis
Data Quality Assessment and Analysis of Automobile Bike Company using Python.

# Goal of Project
The purpose of this project is to conduct a Customer Segmentation Analysis for an Automobile bike Company. Customer segmentation is performed by developing a RFM Model. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a behavior-based approach grouping customers into segments. It groups the customers on the basis of their previous purchase transactions. In this analysis the customer segment was divided into 11 groups. The analysis will help in determining which customers segments should be targeted in order to enhance sales revenue for the company.

1. Data Quality Assessment and Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis on Customer Segments
   1. New vs Old Customers Age Distribution
   2. Bike purchases over last 3 years by Gender
   3. New vs Old Customers Job Industry Distribution
   4. Wealth Segmentation by Age Category
   5. Cars owned by States

   In this analysis the customer segment was divided into 11 groups. The groups being :
   Platinum Customers
   Very Loyal Customers
   Recent Customers
   Potential Customers
   Lost Customers
   Losing Customers
   Late Bloomer
   High Risk Customers
   Evasive Customers
   Becoming Loyal
   Almost lost Customers
4. RFM Analysis: Scatter Plots

# Tools and Technologies used
Python - This was needed to conduct Data Quality Assessment and also for Data Cleaning processes. With Python libraries pandas, matplotlib, seaborn exploratory data analysis of the datasets and to gain useful insights from the data was possible.
